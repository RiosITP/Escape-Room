Field Notes (Blog Post) on an escape room:
Do an escape room. Virtual rooms are ok. In person rooms are optional based on comfort level. Virtual rooms should be cooperative and multiplayer, not single player point and click:
Take note of the design of the room.  What are the rules of the room? How do different players interact with the room and each other? What does the room and its objects look like?  What are the different types of puzzles? How is the game setup? What is the role of the game master?
